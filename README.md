### The future of Competitive TF2
No, seriously, the future. That's why there's nothing here, I'm still working on it. Come back in that mysterious future-time to see something cool. 

I have no idea how you managed to get here, but you can send me an email at `contact@battle.tf` and add me on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/CartConnoisseur) and I'll give you a TF2 key for being cool\*.

<sup>\*If I get flooded with emails about this I will stop giving them out, I'm not incredibly rich. A couple of friends doesn't count as flooding, by the way ;)</sup>
